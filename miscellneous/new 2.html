A queen size bed (Zinus Shalini Upholstered Diamond Stitched Platform Bed / Mattress Foundation) along with an 8-inch coil mattress (Signature Sleep) is available. The bed is dark grey with upholstery which has Diamond stitching. The bed is quite firm and sturdy. The mattress is reversible and features a layer of 1.6-inch high-density foam at the top and bottom of the coil mattress. I bought them in February 2019 so haven't been used much. I love this combination (bed+mattress) but unfortunately, it will be too big for my new place. Here are the links on Amazon.
